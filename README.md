# Material Deep Black Theme

A theme that adds a black colour scheme to Chrome.

In this theme, everything is black or white (with maybe a little bit of grey :3 ). It's as simple as that.

Please leave comments about my theme if you wish to; I enjoy seeing feedback.

For users that wish to have a dark-grey colour scheme instead, please install Material Incognito Dark Theme.
